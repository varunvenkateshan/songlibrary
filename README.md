# SongLibrary
This project allows you to create a playlist manager for a song library of your own songs using Java.

First, begin by adding your own songs and enter the appropriate information. Song Name and Artist Name are required.

This project stores the playlist information on a txt file once the songs are added, so if you close the file and open it back up the previous songs you added to the library will still be there.

You can also add more information to a particular song at any time, and may also remove the song from the library completely.
